    $ shipit list

Will show a list of available targets.

    $ shipit exec uptime

Will execute `uptime` command on remote host.


## Configuration

You need to create `.shipit` file in your project’s directory.

Here is a typical config:

    host='myhost'
    path='sites/example.com'

    [deploy:local]
    git push origin master

    [deploy]
    git checkout master
    git pull
    npm install
    grunt build

    [status]
    uptime

The only required things is `host` and `path` parameters and `[deploy]` or `[deploy:local]`  target.

For non-standard port number, and to specify which SSH key to use, edit your SSH config at `~/.ssh/config`:

```
host example.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/keyfile
port 10022
user usernamehere
```

### Parameters

### host

It’s the same host you use in `ssh` command. It could be string of format `<username>@<ip>:<port>` or just a name of `~/.ssh/config` record.

### path

Project path on remote host. shipit will `cd` to this directory before executing any command.

### Targets

Target is just a bunch of shell command that will be executed on remote host via SSH. You can define as many targets as you want.

Note that you can’t use blank lines inside targets but you can use comments (#) and other things—it’s just a shell script.

### Local targets

If you append `:local` to a target name (like `[name:local]`) it will be executed on your local machine before remote target with the same name. You can define only local, only remote or both targets.

In case of any errors in local target remote target won’t be executed.

You can use these variables:

* `$SSH_HOST` — your config’s `host` value,
* `$SSH_PATH` — your config’s `path` value.

## Examples

### Deploy from Git

    host='myhost'
    path='sites/example.com'

    [deploy:local]
    git push origin master

    [deploy]
    git checkout master
    git pull
    npm install
    npm prune
    npm run build

### Deploy with `rsync`

    host='myhost'
    path='sites/example.com'

    [deploy:local]
    npm test
    npm run build
    rsync --archive --compress --force --delete public/ $SSH_HOST:$SSH_PATH
